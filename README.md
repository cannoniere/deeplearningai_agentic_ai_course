The Agentic AI course from DeepLearning.ai with 3 caveats:  

(1) I didn't pay, so I only have ungraded labs.  
(2) I am using local opensource models only (from Ollama to start).  
(3) I'm using PostgreSQL and PGVector because my group at work does, and I need to learn how to use them.

The notebooks and utils scripts are modified around the limitations above.
